The tests for the Reservations Subsystem were done manually by me,
Harshil Patel. I accounted for all the unit tests I specified which
can be found in the Report 3 document included in this submission.
I had to make sure the user was able to properly communicate through
the website which was inputting/managing data in the database correctly.
